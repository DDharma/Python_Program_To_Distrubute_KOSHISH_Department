What is Koshish ?

Koshish is an organisation cum family comprising of volunteers who work 
together selflessly for the upliftment of underprivileged children. By 
teaching them we wish to empower them to get what they deserve in life. 
We, at Koshish, believe that everyone has got some good in them and that 
they should use this good to help others. Koshish is dedicated to the 
cause of educating young and deserving yet deprived children of slums 
and other such places so that they can find their place among us and 
lead a life of dignity because they deserve better.
“You bring 1 smile on someone’s face and HE will bring 1 smile on your 
face.”
